# Image Scaler
Simple but powerful batch image rescaler.

# Forum post
So a little while ago a friend of mine came up with the idea to write a program that would automatically create SD images for already exising HD (@2x) skin images.
And now that program is done :D.

The program itself looks like this:

By default it will look for all the files in the input folder that have a name than end with @2x and scale them down by a factor 2. It'll also remove the @2x part from the file name of the generated SD image. 
However I decided to make all the filters and parameters configurable so you could actually also use this program to upscale or downscale a whole folder of images.

Well I hope some of you find this program useful :)
And if you find any bugs or thing of nice features feel free to report/request them.
